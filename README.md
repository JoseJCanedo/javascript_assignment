# Week 2 Assignment: JavaScript Fundamentals

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

This assignment introduces you to modern JavaScript (ES6+) syntax and basic asynchronous programming. You'll work with real-world scenarios like managing a simple task list and processing user data. The exercises are designed to be completed in 60-90 minutes.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **Modern Variable Declarations**: Using `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- **Arrow Functions**: Writing cleaner, more concise functions
- **Template Literals**: Building strings with embedded expressions
- **Destructuring**: Extracting values from objects and arrays
- **Promises**: Handling asynchronous operations
- **Basic Modules**: Organizing code across files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, objects)
- Node.js installed on your computer
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment** (link provided by instructor)

2. **Clone your repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd week2-beginner-assignment
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the tests to see what needs to be completed**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Don't worry if tests fail initially - that's expected! ✅

5. **Start coding**:
   - Open the project in your code editor
   - Look for `TODO` comments in the source files
   - Complete each function according to the instructions

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Modern Variables (15 minutes)
**File: `src/01-variables.js`**

Learn the difference between `const`, `let`, and when to use each:
- Create constants for configuration values
- Use `let` for variables that change
- Understand block scoping

### Task 2: Arrow Functions (15 minutes)
**File: `src/02-functions.js`**

Practice modern function syntax:
- Convert regular functions to arrow functions
- Work with function parameters and default values
- Understand when to use arrow functions vs regular functions

### Task 3: Template Literals (15 minutes)
**File: `src/03-templates.js`**

Build dynamic strings using template literals:
- Use `${}` syntax for variable interpolation
- Create multi-line strings
- Format user data for display

### Task 4: Destructuring (20 minutes)
**File: `src/04-destructuring.js`**

Extract values from objects and arrays:
- Destructure object properties
- Work with nested objects
- Use array destructuring for function returns

### Task 5: Basic Promises (20 minutes)
**File: `src/05-promises.js`**

Handle asynchronous operations:
- Work with existing promises using `.then()`
- Handle errors with `.catch()`
- Understand basic async patterns

### Task 6: Simple Modules (10 minutes)
**File: `src/06-modules.js`**

Export functions for use in other files:
- Create named exports
- Export utility functions
- Understand module basics

## 🧪 Testing Your Work

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode (recommended while coding)
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run Specific Test Files
```bash
npm run test:variables    # Test variables only
npm run test:functions    # Test functions only
# ... etc
```

## 📊 Grading

Your assignment will be automatically graded based on passing test cases:

| Task | Points | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Variables | 15 | Proper use of const/let, block scoping |
| Functions | 20 | Arrow functions, default parameters |
| Templates | 15 | Template literals, string interpolation |
| Destructuring | 20 | Object/array destructuring |
| Promises | 20 | Basic promise handling |
| Modules | 10 | Function exports |
| **Total** | **100** | |

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Read the TODO Comments Carefully
Each function has detailed instructions in the comments. Read them twice before coding!

### 2. Run Tests Frequently
After completing each function, run the tests to see if it works:
```bash
npm test
```

### 3. Use Console.log for Debugging
Add `console.log()` statements to understand what your code is doing:
```javascript
function myFunction(data) {
    console.log('Input data:', data); // Debug line
    // Your code here
}
```

### 4. Start Simple
Don't try to write perfect code immediately. Get it working first, then improve it.

### 5. Check the Examples
Each file has example code showing the expected pattern.

## 🔍 Understanding the Test Results

When you run `npm test`, you'll see output like this:

```
✓ Variables: should create user config with const
✗ Functions: should format user greeting
  Expected: "Hello, Alice! Welcome back."
  Received: undefined
```

- ✓ = Test passed (your code works!)
- ✗ = Test failed (needs more work)
- The error message tells you what was expected vs what your code returned

## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've run `npm install`

### Issue: Tests won't run
**Solution**: Check that you're in the correct directory and Node.js is installed

### Issue: "Unexpected token" error
**Solution**: Check for syntax errors like missing brackets or semicolons

### Issue: Function returns `undefined`
**Solution**: Make sure your function has a `return` statement

### Issue: Arrow function not working
**Solution**: Check the syntax: `const myFunc = (param) => { return result; }`

## 📖 Code Examples

Here are some examples of what you'll be working with:

### Variables Example
```javascript
// Instead of var, use const and let
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com'; // Never changes
let userCount = 0; // Will change

function addUser() {
    userCount++; // This is fine with let
}
```

### Arrow Function Example
```javascript
// Old way
function greet(name) {
    return 'Hello, ' + name;
}

// New way (what you'll practice)
const greet = (name) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
};

// Even shorter for simple functions
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
```

### Template Literal Example
```javascript
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };

// Old way
const message = 'Hello, ' + user.name + '! You are ' + user.age + ' years old.';

// New way (what you'll practice)
const message = `Hello, ${user.name}! You are ${user.age} years old.`;
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you've succeeded when:
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test` shows all green checkmarks)
- [ ] Your code uses modern JavaScript syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- [ ] Functions return the expected values according to test specifications
- [ ] No syntax errors or runtime errors

## 🚀 Submission

1. **Complete all TODO items** in the source files
2. **Ensure all tests pass**: `npm test`
3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Week 2 assignment"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Verify on GitHub** that your code is uploaded

The autograder will run when you push to GitHub, and you'll see the results in the "Actions" tab of your repository.
